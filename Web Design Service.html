													<h3>North East and Central Florida Surf Forecasts</h3>
												</header>
												<p>My first website. Here I used Bootstrap for a mobile friendly interface as well as basic CSS and HTML. I took a lot of inspiration of webites I used to browse as a kid trying to understand how to tell if the waves were good like how my dad did using <a href="https://www.cflsurf.com/">cflsurf</a>.</p>

													<h3>Ceramist’s Portfolio</h3>
												</header>
												<p>This website is for an ceramist. I used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This gave me a great introduction to more Font Awesome icons, and getting first-hand experience from a client with a clear idea of what kind of website and apporach they wanted.</p>

													<h3><strong>Background and Upcoming Projects</strong></h3>
												</header>
													<p>I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, which I use as the backbone for crafting websites and web applications. 
														Over time, I’ve gained experience with frameworks and tools like React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, though my initial foray into these technologies was a steep learning curve. 
														I dove headfirst into a project using these tools without first mastering the basics, which taught me the importance of building a solid foundation. 
														This lesson shaped how I approach learning new technologies and solving challenges in web development.
													</p>

													<h3><strong>Professional Contributions: Building a Better Online Presence</strong></h3>
												</header>
													<p>At my current company, I played a key role in revamping our web presence. Our old website was outdated and unreliable, so I took on the challenge of creating a brand-new responsive site. 
														This involved implementing a PHP mail server to enable seamless functionality for the contact form, ensuring potential clients could easily reach out.</p>
													<p>The new website was developed using Odoo, which required me to adapt to a new CMS and integrate essential features while maintaining a sleek and professional design. 
														Additionally, I worked on the existing WordPress-based site, contributing updates and improvements that enhanced functionality and user experience. 
														These projects not only strengthened my ability to work with different platforms but also deepened my understanding of creating user-focused designs with measurable impact.

														<h3><strong>Expanding My Skills: Angular and PHP</strong></h3>
													</header>
													<p>To stay ahead in the fast-paced world of web development, I’ve been diving into Angular and PHP, learning through hands-on projects and self-guided study. 
														Angular’s component-based architecture is particularly exciting as it offers new ways to streamline and scale complex applications. 
														PHP, on the other hand, is helping me solidify backend development skills while broadening the range of features I can offer in my projects. 
														Both technologies challenge me to think differently and expand my approach to solving problems.</p>
